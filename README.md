# Pong Clone
This is a remake of the 1972 classic game, Pong. It was created with python as it's underlying programming language and kivy for the graphical user interface.

To play the game, a user must drag each of the paddles up and down using a mouse or other touch input. The game also supports movement via the keyboard. Player one may move up and down with W and S respectively, player 2 may move up and down with the up and down arrow keys.

####Bugs
1. There is a problem with multiple keys being pressed at once, only one key will trigger.
2. Movement via the keyboard is incremental and slow, should be "smoother".
3. The game will continue indefinitely.
